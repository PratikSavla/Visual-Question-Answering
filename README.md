# Visual-Question-Answering

This is Visual Question Answering Application using keras. It uses VGG16 model for image feature extraction.
It is trained on [VQA Dataset](http://visualqa.org/download.html)

## Dependency

1. Keras version 2.0+
2. Tensorflow 1.2+
3. scikit-learn
4. Spacy version 2.0+
    * To upgrade & install Glove Vectors
       * python -m spacy download en_vectors_web_lg
5. OpenCV 

Download the pretrained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vlVDWGP_xwBaqZnFFTRwpSDriLxu-tHM?usp=sharing)
